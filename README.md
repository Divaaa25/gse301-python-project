# GSE301 Python Project – Student Academic Performance Analysis System

## Project Overview
This project is part of the **GSE301: Data Science – Python Fundamentals** course requirement at the University of Ilorin. It implements a **console-based Student Academic Performance Analysis System** using core Python concepts.

The system stores, processes, and analyzes mock academic data for students and provides an interactive menu to perform common academic-related operations.

---

## Project Objectives
The objectives of this project are to:
- Apply Python fundamentals to a real-world academic scenario
- Demonstrate proper use of Python data structures
- Implement conditional logic and error handling
- Build an interactive, menu-driven console application
- Write clean, readable, and well-structured Python code

---

## Features
The system provides the following features:
1. View all registered students
2. Add a new student record
3. Check eligibility for graduation
4. Find the top-performing student
5. Exit the system

---

## Python Concepts Demonstrated
This project demonstrates the following Python concepts:
- Variable declaration and data types
- Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Pattern matching using `match-case`
- Functions and return values
- Logical operators (`and`, `or`)
- Exception handling using `try-except`
- List slicing and indexing
- Set operations (union, intersection, difference)
- User input handling and type casting

## How to Run the Project 
https://github.com/Divaaa25/gse301-python-project.git

Navigate into the project folder:
gse301-python-project

Run the Python script:
python student_analysis.py

Follow the on-screen menu instructions to interact with the system.

Sample Menu Display
============================================
     Student Academic Performance System
============================================

Loading student records...

5 student profiles loaded successfully.
--------------------------------------------

Menu Options
1. View all students
2. Add new student
3. Check eligibility for graduation
4. Find top performer
5. Exit
--------------------------------------------

Graduation Eligibility Criteria
A student is eligible for graduation if:
CGPA is 2.5 or above
There are no outstanding courses
The student is currently active

Biggest Challenge
One of the biggest challenges encountered during this project was combining multiple Python concepts—such as data structures, conditional logic, and match-case—into a single, well-structured program while maintaining clean output and proper error handling.
